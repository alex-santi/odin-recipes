        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><p>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. <br>
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</p></li>
            <li><p>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</p></li>
            <li><p>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. <br>
                Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. <br>
                The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</p></li>
            <li><P>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.<br>
                 Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</P></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve and enjoy!</p></li>
